# Applications of vectors in real life
1. Game development
2. Training models using neural networks

# Matrices
They help as organize data into grids
Matrices are arrays with rows and columns
Steps of hypothesis testing
Central limit theorem
if the p_value < std_dev we reject the null hypothesis, otherwise we fail to reject
